		<div class=intro>I've been listening to Mac Miller for a long time without even realizing it. I've heard his songs on the radio but never really knew who he was or really got into his music until January 2020 when my boyfriend and I were driving to Maine for my dad's funeral and he suggested we listen to his newly released album, Circles. Ever since then I've listened to Mac's music almost religiously. It started with the album Circles for a couple of months until I started to branch out to some of his other music and albums including Swimming and GO:OD AM. These albums help me relax, feel good, calm down, and feel peace. It's helpful that some of the songs I can relate to on a personal level.

		<div>As a delivery driver, and someone who loves to drive in general, I spend a lot of time in the car, listening to music. It's a form of therapy for me. When I'm feeling particularly anxious, stressed, or tense, I turn up my Mac playlist. In my car I have the speakers adjusted to have the bass be prominent and when I play my music, especially Mac Miller, I love feeling the bass in my core and chest. It soothes me completely.
